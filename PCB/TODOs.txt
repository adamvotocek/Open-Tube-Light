MAINBOARD
Problems:
-no pulldown resistor on 5v enable
-dc jack slots too much tolerance - wiggles from side to side
-add some gnd test points for soldering
-vias in text make it bad sometimes
-no indication for temp sensor orientation
-old project name
-no thermal reliefs on dc jack, terminals makes it hard to solder correctly
-temp sensors are hard to solder because of the pitch, make the footprint a bit wider
-change name on pcb

Connector Boards
