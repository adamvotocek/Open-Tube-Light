| **OpPoll**           | 0x2000 | Receive          |      ✅      | **Discovery Packet.** All entities must receive this and allow the controller to discover them. The Node must respond with an ArtPollReply.                                         |
| **OpPollReply**      | 0x2100 | Transmit         |      ✅      | **Status Packet.** This contains the device status and is transmitted in response to OpPoll.                                                                                        |
